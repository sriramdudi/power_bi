# Project Title: Activities Analysis A Power BI Project 📊

The project's objective is to utilize real simulated dataset files representing various aspects of a company's activities to create a Power BI Dashboard. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to clean, analyze, transform, model, visualize, and extract insights driving actionable recommendations using Power BI.


## Data Sources 📂🔢
The project involves three CSV files: '**clients**', '**employees**', and '**shifts**', each containing 
specific data related to clients, employees, and employee shifts, respectively.

1. Clients CSV:
   
      • This file contains information about the clients, including client ID, full name, birth date, gender, status, admission date, client location, and           whether the client has Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).

      • Objective: Analyze the client data and create visualizations that provide insights into 
        the client population.

      • Key Focus Areas: Explore patterns, demographics, and trends related to client status, gender distribution, admission dates, and ADLs.

 2. Employees CSV:

      • This file contains information about the employees, including employee ID, full name, status, employee job title, birthday, hire date, employee              location, and gender.

      • Objective: Analyze and visualize employee data to gain insights into the employee demographics and workforce.

      • Key Focus Areas: Explore employee status, job titles, gender distribution, and other 
        relevant factors that can help understand the employee base better.

 3. Shifts CSV:
    
      • This file contains information about shifts worked by the employees, including shift ID, shift start date, shift punched status, client ID, employee         ID, shift start time, shift end time of day, shift punch start time, and shift punch end time of day.

      • Objective: Analyze the shift data to uncover patterns and trends related to employee 
        shifts.

      • Key Focus Areas: Visualize shift start dates, punch statuses, shift durations, and other insights that can optimize staffing and scheduling                  processes.

These CSV files serve as the primary data sources for the activities analysis Power BI  project. They are used for data analysis, visualization, and deriving insights.
